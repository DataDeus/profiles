    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_SARS">#EndSARS</a> protests in Nigeria,
        the words, “Profile”, “Profiling” became quite common due to Police brutality. <br>
        <br>Being that everyday people were being profiled day the Nigerian police by their looks, as a means of extorting them.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Curiosity</h2>
    <p>This begs the question, isn’t this quite inherent? - That our perceptions can drive inferences?</p> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>We can guess a person’s age by looking at their face?</li> <br>
        <li>We can tell a military officer by how they dress?</li>
    </ul> <br>
    <p>These questions depict the inherency of profiling (something we unconsciously do everyday) and if humans can profile people, can computers also?</p><br>
    
    <h2>Logic</h2>
    <p>
        Humans are able to profile humans because of data; if you see a person’s picture, you can guess their gender, race and age. <br> <br>
        This then means that if computers will be able to profile a person, data is also important and one place that computers can get data on people is on the open internet.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p>
        Thanks to Social Media, the World has become more of a global village, which means we are more connected and more information is being shared. <br> <br>
        This sets the notion that you can learn about a person by looking through their social media, 
        this is validated by how people go through the social media profiles of people they are emotionally attracted to, 
        so they can note inferences and build a perspective just by looking at their social media profiles. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Profiles</h2>
    <p>
        Profiles allows users to analyse their social media profiles, presenting them with psychographic insights based off their social media data in a presentable, 
        engaging and informative way - we call it profile (so when you analyse your social media, your profile of psychographic insights is generated for you)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>These psychographic insights are based off your:</p> <br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Interest</li>
        <li>Personality</li>
    </ul> <br>

    <p>Later on, we will add more psychographic measures like:</p> <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Behavioural patterns</li>
        <li>Behavioural changes</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Big Picture</h2>
    <p>
        Being that the users of social media are also the product of those platforms as user data is being sold to advertisers. 
        This means that people who are the owners of their own data, we are not the earners of their own data.<br><br>

        We at profiles are betting that we can allow our users have their data as an NFT that can be leased(traded) to advertisers on the blockchain. 
        This then allows the creator, owner and earner of personal data to be one person (the user themselves) <br><br>

        We are betting that we can solve the problem of users not being incentivised for their high-value data 
    </p> 
    <br>

    <h2>Questions and Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that what we are doing is quite novel and we understand that it is a topic with lots of questions and concerns. <br> <br>
        Perhaps the concept of trading your data is foreign to you. <a href="https://www.itheum.io/">Itheum</a> is a company that is doing just that. <br> <br>
        Should you have even deeper concerns and questions, we kindly appeal that you fill this <a href="https://forms.gle/6Y2v8bunAofpdUDMA" target="_blank">form.</a>
